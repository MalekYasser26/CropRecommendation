# CropRecommendation
This repository contains the code and resources for our graduation project from NTI, where we developed a Crop Recommendation System. The project leverages machine learning to analyze soil properties and environmental conditions to predict the best crops to plant in a given area, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability. 

# Project Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about what crops to plant based on the analysis of soil properties and other environmental factors. The system uses a dataset that includes features such as pH, Soil EC, Phosphorus, Potassium, Urea, T.S.P, M.O.P, Moisture, and Temperature to predict the most suitable crop for a given soil sample.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

pH
Soil EC (Electrical Conductivity)
Phosphorus
Potassium
Urea
T.S.P (Triple Superphosphate)
M.O.P (Muriate of Potash)
Moisture
Temperature
Plant Type (target variable) 

# Results
The Crop Recommendation System provides accurate predictions for the best crops to plant based on the analyzed soil properties and environmental conditions.
